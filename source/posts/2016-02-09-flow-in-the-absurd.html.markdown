## Flow

Flow (or flow state, also known as "the Zone" and occasionally synonymous with "hyper-focus") is a concept laid out by Mihály Csíkszentmihályi which can be defined as the point of conciousness at which one's skills are stretched by a challenge that are in line with their abilities, thus focusing the maximum amount of attention on this challenge and producing contentment and enjoyment during and after performing the task.

*Flow is an achievement of the optimal experience within a given context.*

## The Absurd

Absurdism is a school of thought pioneered by Søren Kierkegaard and Albert Camus which states that humans have an innate desire to seek and find meaning in life but are ultimately unable to do so.

This is closely related to what we know as Existentialism as well as Nihilism, but is different in that existentialism focuses on one's free will and encouragement of creating one's own meaning, nihilism focuses on the futility of the effort to find this meaning and encourages not even trying, while Absurdism's focus is to accept this disconnect and live a contented life knowing that one will not find meaning despite his efforts to do so, and that it is possible to make the seeking of meaning the meaning in itself.

To emphasize and reiterate - _while we may be ultimately unable to find a true meaning of life, we can and should find meaning in the pursuit of seeking it_.

Maybe seeking the meaning of life is simply living it.

If that is true, we can probably assume there are people out there that want to optimize their experience in this pursuit.
