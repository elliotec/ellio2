#"Dream Gig"

At the beginning of this year, I was managing a software team on a project that was... less than significant in the eyes of myself and most of the company I was working for. The business owner was by all accounts terrible, and the dev team did not have clear requirements and had a lot of time sitting on their hands waiting for orders that were yet to come.

I was feeling burned out working on a lame project and having little to do but deflect annoying micromanagement from my dev team, when what seemed like a fantastic opportunity arose from my network. It was kind of a dream gig - an opportunity teaching my skills as an engineering instructor for one of the largest code schools in the nation which was just entering our city.

It seemed perfect - I had always loved teaching and had done so in some capacity since beginning to code professionally. They were offering a 20% salary increase to what I was at, with great benefits and a month off every three months, with the addition of "unlimited PTO" (a trap and a racket, as most people have found out now). They promised only one travel per year for the all hands conference, and were in the middle of remodeling a new space in a building a short bike ride from where I lived. It seemed a little to good to be true.

I got hired in mid March, with the intention that I'd start teaching at the end of March. I thought I had 2 weeks to write my curriculum, and did it frantically knowing I'd have to adjust to the students needs
